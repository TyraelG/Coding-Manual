					Welcome to our coding web page! 
					Our goal is to help out people that are interested in coding wether they're beginners or adavnced.
					Feel free to browse and navigate around our website and video links.
					We hope that you can learn a thing or two from our website!
				</p>

				<p>
					There are 3 different main types of code that we focus on in our website. The first one is HTML. HTML outlines the basic structure of the webpage. The second type is CSS. CSS is the style of the site. This includes color, fonts, sizes, and spacing. The last one is Javascript. Javascript controls all of the actions and is also in control of the program responding to the user's actions.
