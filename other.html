				<h1>DOM</h1>
				<p>
					The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML, XML and SVG documents. It provides a structured representation of the document as a tree. The DOM defines methods that allow access to the tree, so that they can change the document structure, style and content. The DOM provides a representation of the document as a structured group of nodes and objects, possessing various properties and methods. Nodes can also have event handlers attached to them, and once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed. Essentially, it connects web pages to scripts or programming languages; translates.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the DOM is often accessed using JavaScript, it is not a part of the JavaScript language. It can also be accessed by other languages.
				</p>
				<h1>XML</h1>
				<p>
					eXtensible Markup Language (XML) is a generic markup language specified by the W3C. The information technology (IT) industry uses many languages based on XML as data-description languages.

					XML tags resemble HTML tags, but XML is much more flexible because it lets users define their own tags. In this way XML acts like a meta-languageâ€”that is, it can be used to define other languages, such as RSS. Moreover, HTML is a presentation language, whereas XML is a data-description language. This means that XML has far broader applications than just the Web. For example, Web services can use XML to exchange requests and responses.

				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>
					We created this website because of our love for code and our will to help others understand the concept of coding. We created this website in a class created by devleague that runs in Hawaii. It was so fun to create this website with everyone and we encourage others deeply to try coding classes if they please. We hope that you will learn at least a few things about coding from our website information.
